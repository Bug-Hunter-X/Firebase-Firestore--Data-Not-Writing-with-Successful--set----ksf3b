This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Firebase Firestore where data fails to write despite the `set()` operation appearing successful. The bug is reproduced in `firestoreBug.js`. The solution, implementing a retry mechanism, is provided in `firestoreBugSolution.js`.  The issue is related to intermittent network connectivity or Firebase service unavailability; this robust approach addresses this scenario.
