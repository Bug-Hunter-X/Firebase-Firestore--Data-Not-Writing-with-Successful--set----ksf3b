In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't being written to the Firestore database despite seemingly correct code. The `set()` method appeared to execute without errors, but the data remained absent from the database.  I checked the rules, which were permissive, and verified the correct path and data structure. The problem persisted across different devices and network conditions.
